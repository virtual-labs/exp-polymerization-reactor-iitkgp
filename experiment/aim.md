## Aim of experiment

- Polymerization Reactors Process optimization and control can have a significant strategic impact on polymer plant operability and economics. The operating objectives in polymerization processes must satisfy complex property requirements for the final polymer and simultaneously achieve the greatest economic potential during the batch operation.
